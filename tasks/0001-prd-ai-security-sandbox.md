# Product Requirements Document: SafeHive AI Security Sandbox

## Introduction/Overview

The SafeHive AI Security Sandbox is a CLI-based demonstration and testing platform that simulates a food-ordering workflow where AI assistants interact with potentially malicious vendors, payment services, and external APIs. The system addresses the critical need for organizations to understand and protect against novel AI attack vectors in real-world scenarios.

**Problem Statement:** As AI assistants become integrated into everyday business workflows (like food ordering), they face new security risks from malicious actors who may attempt to manipulate AI behavior through prompt injection, data exfiltration, or social engineering attacks. Traditional security measures are insufficient for these AI-specific threats.

**Goal:** Create an interactive sandbox that demonstrates AI security vulnerabilities and showcases advanced protection mechanisms through four specialized AI security guards, with a focus on the innovative Honeypot Guard that uses deception-based defense.

## Goals

1. **Demonstrate AI Security Risks:** Provide a realistic environment where users can observe how AI assistants can be manipulated by malicious actors
2. **Showcase Advanced AI Defense:** Highlight four distinct AI security guard mechanisms, with special emphasis on the Honeypot Guard's deception-based approach
3. **Enable Interactive Learning:** Allow security teams and stakeholders to experience AI attacks and defenses in a controlled, educational environment
4. **Support Client Demonstrations:** Provide a compelling, hands-on demo tool for A10's AI security solutions
5. **Generate Actionable Insights:** Produce metrics and logs that help organizations understand their AI security posture

## User Stories

**As a security researcher**, I want to test different attack patterns against AI assistants so that I can understand emerging AI security threats and develop better defenses.

**As a DevOps engineer**, I want to see how AI systems behave under attack so that I can implement appropriate monitoring and protection in production environments.

**As a sales engineer**, I want to demonstrate AI security risks to potential clients so that I can showcase A10's advanced AI protection capabilities.

**As a security team lead**, I want to train my team on AI attack patterns so that they can better identify and respond to AI-related security incidents.

**As a compliance officer**, I want to understand how AI systems handle sensitive data under attack so that I can ensure regulatory compliance in AI deployments.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Sandbox Functionality
1. The system must provide a CLI interface for launching and controlling the AI security sandbox
2. The system must simulate a complete food-ordering workflow with multiple AI agents (Orchestrator, User Twin, Vendor Agents)
3. The system must support both honest and malicious vendor behaviors through configurable AI agents
4. The system must provide human-in-the-loop controls for approving, redacting, or quarantining suspicious activities
5. The system must generate realistic dummy data for testing scenarios without exposing real PII

### AI Security Guards
6. **Privacy Sentry:** The system must detect and prevent over-sharing of personal data (credit card numbers, addresses, health preferences)
7. **Task Navigator:** The system must ensure AI assistants stick to original task constraints (e.g., "vegetarian pizza under $20")
8. **Prompt Sanitizer:** The system must filter malicious or manipulative vendor inputs before they reach the AI assistant
9. **Honeypot Guard:** The system must detect known attack patterns (SQL injection, XSS, Path Traversal) and serve convincing dummy data after threshold violations

### Attack Detection & Response
10. The system must detect at least three OWASP attack patterns: SQL injection, XSS, and Path Traversal
11. The system must maintain per-source-IP attempt counters with configurable thresholds (default: 3 attempts)
12. The system must generate and serve synthetic dummy data (fake credit cards, order history) when attack thresholds are exceeded
13. The system must alert stakeholders with detailed incident information when attacks are detected
14. The system must provide CLI options to approve decoy responses, quarantine vendors, or ignore incidents

### Configuration & Monitoring
15. The system must support YAML-based configuration for enabling/disabling guards and setting thresholds
16. The system must provide a `--metrics` CLI flag that displays summary statistics (attacks caught, decoys served, alerts raised)
17. The system must generate structured logs for all security events and incidents
18. The system must support both pre-configured attack scenarios and custom user-defined scenarios

### Integration & Data Handling
19. The system must use Ollama for local AI model execution to ensure privacy and control
20. The system must support export of incident data and metrics for integration with existing security tools
21. The system must handle only synthetic/dummy data in the MVP to avoid compliance issues
22. The system must provide clear separation between test data and any real data if added in future versions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real PII Handling:** The MVP will not handle real personal information or payment data
2. **Production Deployment:** This is a demonstration and testing tool, not a production security solution
3. **Advanced ML Detection:** The MVP will use rule-based detection rather than machine learning models
4. **Multi-tenant Support:** The system will run as a single-user CLI tool
5. **Cloud Integration:** The MVP will be a local-only tool without cloud connectivity
6. **Real-time Network Monitoring:** The system simulates attacks rather than monitoring live network traffic
7. **Compliance Certification:** The MVP will not include formal compliance certifications (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)

## Design Considerations

### CLI User Experience
- Use `typer` framework with `rich` for interactive menus, colors, and progress indicators
- Provide clear, actionable prompts for human-in-the-loop decisions
- Display real-time status updates during attack simulations
- Use consistent color coding: red for attacks, green for safe operations, yellow for warnings

### Agent Communication
- Implement standardized request/response formats between orchestrator and guards
- Use clear, descriptive logging with structured data for easy parsing
- Provide detailed incident reports with attack patterns, source information, and response actions

### Configuration Management
- Use YAML configuration files for easy modification of guard settings
- Provide sensible defaults that work out-of-the-box
- Support runtime configuration changes where appropriate

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Core Language:** Python 3.10+ for main development
- **CLI Framework:** typer with rich for interactive interface
