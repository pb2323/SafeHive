# SafeHive AI Security Sandbox - Agent System Prompts

This document shows the system prompts for each agent in the SafeHive AI Security Sandbox, explaining what each agent is designed to do.

## Available Methods

Each agent now has a `get_system_prompt_description()` method that returns the system prompt explaining the agent's purpose and behavior.

### Usage Example

```python
# Get the system prompt for any agent
orchestrator = OrchestratorAgent("agent_id", config)
prompt = orchestrator.get_system_prompt_description()
print(prompt)
```

## Implementation Details

Each agent class now includes the `get_system_prompt_description()` method:

```python
def get_system_prompt_description(self) -> str:
    """
    Returns the system prompt that explains what this agent is designed to do.
    This method is used for documentation and demonstration purposes.
    """
    return """[Agent-specific system prompt content]"""
```

This method provides a clear, comprehensive description of what each agent is designed to do, making it easy to explain the system to judges, stakeholders, or new team members.
